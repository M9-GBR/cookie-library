This library helps with the setting, removal and modification of browser cookies.

How to use:
- In a non-module project include <script src='./cookie-library/cookie_lib.js'></script> to your html file and then use the pre-defined "cookieSaver" variable to start using cookies.
- For a module project use the following code: "import cookieSaver from './cookie-library/cookie_lib_module.js'" to start using cookies.
